* I studied law at uni.
* I then spent 3 years copyediting and proofreading for a legal information website before starting my coding journey.
* I'm now part of the [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) bootcamp.
* I'm interested in all things related to software development but especially UX/UI design.
